# Regressions_Other_R
Regression models other than linear and multiple in R
Position salaries dataset contains the data about the level of the employee and his salary. The goal of the new regression is to predict 
the salary to be offered to the new employee based on his current level.
Polynomial regression, decision tree regression, support vector regression and random forest regressions are used here.
